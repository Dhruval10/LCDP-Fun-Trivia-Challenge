## Welcome to LCDP Fun Trivia Challenge

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Dhruval10/LCDP-Fun-Trivia-Challenge/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### How to use this

Just download this project. Go to your Dialogflow. Click on gear icon next to your project name. Go to Export and Import.
Click on restore from zip.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Dhruval10/LCDP-Fun-Trivia-Challenge/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
